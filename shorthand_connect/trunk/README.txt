This plugin provides a simple method for publishing and updating Shorthand stories directly inside of Wordpress.

This plugin will allow premium Shorthand users to connect their Wordpress installation to Shorthand (http://app.shorthand.com).  This will allow users to single click publish Shorthand stories into Wordpress.

== Installation ==

1a. Install the search for the plugin and install it within wp-admin:
1b. Or, Upload `shorthand_connect` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add your credentials:
V1 - Go to Settings > Shorthand and enter in your user ID and API Key (get these from your account page in the Shorthand editor).
v2 - Go to your organisation in the top right, and click the cog to get to settings.  Scroll to the bottom, and generate a new key.  Go to Settings > Shorthand and enter in your Token.
4. Optionally change the CSS settings in the options to best present stories within your theme.
