This plugin provides a simple method for publishing and updating Shorthand stories directly inside of Wordpress.

== Description ==

This plugin will allow premium Shorthand users to connect their Wordpress installation to Shorthand (http://app.shorthand.com).  This will allow users to single click publish Shorthand stories into Wordpress.

== Installation ==

1. Install the search for the plugin and install it within wp-admin.
  - Or alternately upload `shorthand_connect` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings -> Shorthand to add your Shorthand API Token retrieved in the next step.
3. Get your API token from Shorthand.com: (Only Admin/Owners will have access to generate API Tokens)
  - Open the workspace settings; either by clicking your organisation name from the dashboard OR from the top right menu when editing a story.
  - Under the sub-heading API Tokens generate either a Team Token or Workspace Token.
     - A Team Token only has access to published/prepared stories under the associated team.
     - A Workspace Token has access to all published/prepared stories.
4. Optionally change the CSS settings in the options to best present stories within your theme.
5. Optionally your theme can override the display of Shorthand stories via `single-shorthand_story.php` in your theme directory.
6. Optionally apply post-processing in the form of regex queries; within Settings, Post-Processing.
